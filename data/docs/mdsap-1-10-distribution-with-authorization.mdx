<RegLang>
Confirm that the medical device organization has defined and implemented controls to ensure that only devices that have received the appropriate marketing authorization are distributed or otherwise offered for commercial distribution into the applicable markets. 
</RegLang>

<ReportLang>
Controls related to marketing authorization are as documented in Task 6-25 Review of customer requirements, distribution records.
</ReportLang>

This placement of this task is an audit model flaw, as it clearly should be considered as part of production controls in Chapter 6. This task is partially redundant and inseparable from <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-25 Review of customer requirements, distribution records</QLink>.

As to be confirmed in the linked task, the process for reviewing and handling customer orders is to ensure that customer order acceptance is contingent upon order geography and marketing authorization.
