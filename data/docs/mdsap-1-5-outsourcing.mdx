Canada (HC): Verify that the roles and responsibilities of any regulatory correspondents, importers, distributors, or providers of a service are clearly documented in the medical device organizationâ€™s quality management system and are qualified as suppliers and controlled, as appropriate.

<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm the extent of outsourced processes."}>
The extent of outsourcing helps 
- confirm the established QMS scope, and 
- inform sampling for the remainder of the audit.

Ask the management representative or the supply chain expert to describe which processes are outsourced.  

Confirm by reviewing the approved suppliers list for companies which appear to be providing outsourced activities. 
</Subtask>

It is not the goal to understand how suppliers are controlled at this point in the audit, that it to be done in Chapter 7.  This task is only related to becoming informed for the remainder of the audit. 

For example, teams which outsource manufacturing will naturally not have QMS instruction related to manufacturing, but an auditor would expect them to have other instruction such as how to conduct design transfer with the external manufacturing firm.  Knowing the outsourced processes at the beginning of the audit can enable meaningful linkages throughout the rest of the audit.
