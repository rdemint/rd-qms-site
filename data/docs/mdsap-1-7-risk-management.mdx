<ReportLang>
The organization mitigates risk through the QMS policies, procedures, and practices as observed throughout the audit.

Product risk reviewed in Chapter 5.

There are no action items related to this task, as this task if evidenced by many other tasks throughout the audit. 

This task is redundant to other tasks, particularly Chapter 3 for post-market surveillance and Chapter 5 for product risk management. 

'Risk' has become more and more of a buzzword since ISO 13485:2016, but many teams fundamentally misunderstand that the quality management system is a system to manage risk. QMS processes (i.e. Design controls, purchasing, internal audit, CAPA, etc.) all contribute to risk mitigation. There need not be any unique 'QMS risk management' processes.
