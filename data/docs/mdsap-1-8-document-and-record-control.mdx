MDSAP Task 1-8: Verify that procedures have been defined,  documented, and implemented for the control of documents and records of both internal and external origin required by the quality management system. 

Confirm the medical device organization retains records and at least one obsolete copy  of controlled documents for a period of time at least equivalent to the lifetime of the  device, but not less than two years from the date of product release.

Australia (TGA): Confirm that Quality Management System documentation and records in relation to a device described in TG(MD)R Sch3 P1 1.9 are retained by the Manufacturer for at least 5 years.
Brazil (ANVISA): Verify that change records include a description of the change, identification of the affected 
documents, the signature of the approving individual(s), the approval date, and when the change becomes effective. Confirm that the manufacturer maintains a master list of the approved and effective documents. Verify that electronic records and documents have backups
Japan (MHLW): Confirm that Quality Management System documentation and records in relation to a device are 
retained for 5 years or 15 years for specially designated maintenance control devices.
United States (FDA): Verify that electronic records and documents have backups

<Subtask actionitem={"Review a document index"}>
Ask the management representative or document control team member for a list of documents in table format.  Ideally, this table will have
- Document ID
- Document title
- Document revision
- Last revised
A <Qdoc>QMS document index</Qdoc> is an essential reference point to be used throughout the rest of the audit. It is useful for 
- recording information in your report, 
- setting expectations about the revisions of documents to see, and 
- gaining visibility to procedures and other document types that might not be referenced by other procedures.

Brazil refers to a 'master list' and FDA a 'quality system record', both of which are what is meant by a <Qdoc>QMS document index</Qdoc>.  
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review document/change control procedures"}>
Gain an understanding of what forms and approvals are to be expected for a change. Teams may require different forms,  approvals, and training for different change types (i.e. significant, non-significant, design-related, etc.).
This is an opportunity to identify sampling relevant to <QLink>MDSAP Task 2-3 Notification of changes</QLink> as well as <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-13 Design and development change</QLink>, although the actions can be fully explored in those tasks.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm the extent of use electronic documents, records, and signatures"}>
Electronic documents are commonly managed as Word/PDF files on limited access folders, whether local or cloud.  They may also be integrated with eQMS software.  Confirm controls are in place or validation has been performed commensurate with risk.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm record retention policies"}>
Record retention typically varies depending on record type.  
If sampling any old records, make a link to other tasks.  For example, a process that was recently revalidated, the old validation could be reviewed to provide evidence that obsolete documents are maintained. It could also be reviewed to confirm whether any specifications or acceptance criteria changed (a link to <QLink>MDSAP Task-8: Process validation</QLink>). 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Identify and sample changes"}>
Interview available team members and request a verbal summary of changes that may be relevant to sampling for change control tasks. 
Mentally note these changes and compare later in <QLink>MDSAP Task 1-9 Management review</QLink>, which is to consider changes that could affect the quality management system. 
Also review a <Qdoc>Document Change List</Qdoc> to see a full and establish list of both completed and uncompleted changes.  Sample and aim to identify examples of changes from different change types including product, process, etc.

- quality management system process change (i.e. Purchasing)
- equipment/resource change
- change in in-process control/verification
- <QLink>design change that resulted from a corrective action (Task 3-6)</QLink>
- <QLink>process change that resulted from a corrective action (Task 3-7)</QLink>

This tasks goal is to assess that the change was controlled and implemented.  The links that can be made to corrective action and other tasks can be reviewed later. 
</Subtask>
<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm the extent of use of hard-copy documents and records"}>
Hard copy documents are more common in production areas where computers may not be accessible, and hard-copy records (lot record, training record) may travel with a batch of product or material.
Confirm whether or not there is a means (e.g. document distribution log) for hard-copy documents that are not consumed with a production batch (e.g. DHR template that is consumed to create a lot record).
</Subtask>

This MDSAP task is a prime example of MDSAP language needing improvement.  The MDSAP audit model describes this task links as "None", which is crazy because it clearly sets the stage for many other tasks throughout the audit.

In summary, this is a very important task that can influence sampling for the remainder of the audit.
