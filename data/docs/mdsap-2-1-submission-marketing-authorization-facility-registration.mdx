<Subtask actionitem={"Review available online databases for registration and listing."}>
US, Canada, and Australia maintain online public databases related to registration and listing.  These are sources of truth.

This task is acknowledged to be somewhat confusing.  It is overlapping with <QLink>MDSAP Task 2-2 Evidence of Marketing Clearance or Approval</QLink>, because 
- the 'evidence of marketing clearance' also supplies evidence of the submission for marketing authorization required by this task. 
- the device listings reviewed in this task provide evidence of marketing clearance or approval because they reference marketing authorization numbers (i.e. medical device license number, 510(k) number).
Regardless, it may be helpful to focus on registrations and device listings in this task and list out particular marketing authorization numbers in Task 2-2 to facilitate later sampling.
