Confirm the medical device organization has received appropriate marketing clearance or approval in the regulatory jurisdictions where the medical device organization markets their devices.

United States (FDA): Device pathways include premarket notification or premarket approval. 

Canada (HC): No person shall import or sell a Class II, III or IV medical device unless the Manufacturer of the device 
holds a license.

Australia (TGA):Marketing authorization (inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods [ARTG]) is granted 
to the Australian Sponsor. A Sponsor is provided with a Certificate of Inclusion in the ARTG to identify the 
products that have been granted marketing authorization. Products with marketing authorization may be identified from the public facing ARTG database.

Brazil (ANVISA): In Brazil there are two kinds of marketing clearance, registration and notification. Device market clearance shall be requested to ANVISA by the domestic manufacturer or importer (legal representative) formally established in Brazil. 
- Registration is a comprehensive process for market authorization, applied to medical devices in classes III and IV. Registration is valid for 10 years. 
- Notification is a simplified market authorization process, applied to all medical devices classes I. Notifications have no expiry date.

Japan (MHLW): A license must be obtained by the prefectural government, and the license holder is called the "marketing authorization holder" and must reside in Japan. Applications for Marketing Approval/Certification (class 2, 3, or 4 medical device) or Notification for Marketing (class 1 medical device) are required.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review evidence of marketing authorization for currently marketed devices."}>
As mentioned in <QLink>MDSAP Task 2-1</QLink> the device listings reviewed in the previous task should provide evidence of marketing clearance or approval because they reference marketing authorization numbers (i.e. medical device license number, 510(k) number).  Public government databases are a source of truth and provide evidence of marketing authorization.

The list of countries gathered here should be referenced again when distribution records and regulatory reporting are reviewed.
