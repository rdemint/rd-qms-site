<Subtask actionitem={"Review previous internal audit reports against internal audit procedures."}>
Compare previous internal audit reports against internal procedures, ensuring that frequency,documentation, scope, length, etc. are as required.

The industry standard frequency for internal audits is annual, with most companies spending three days, and two to five days being common.

It should be considered a best practice to have an internal audit performed by an outside firm.
