Confirm that the medical device organization has made effective arrangements for gaining experience from the post-production phase, including postmarket surveillance, handling complaints, and investigating the cause of nonconformities related to advisory notices with provision for feedback into the Measurement, Analysis and Improvement process. 
Select records of complaints for review that represent the highest risk to the user or have the largest impact on the ability of the device to meet its essential design outputs.
Verify that information from the analysis of production and post-production quality data was considered for amending the analysis of product risk, as appropriate.

Australia(TGA): Verify that the medical device organization has procedures for a post-marketing system that includes a 
systematic review of post-production experience (e.g. from; expert user groups, customer surveys, customer complaints and warranty claims, service and repair information, literature reviews, post production clinical trials, user feedback other than complaints, device tracking and registration schemes, user reactions during training, adverse event reports). Investigation should take place in a timely manner to ensure that reporting timeframes for adverse events or the implementation of advisory notices (recalls) may be met by the Australian Sponsor [TG(MD)R Sch3 P1 1.4(3)(a)].
Brazil (ANVISA): Requirements are listed which are redundant. 
Canada (HC): Canada has unique requirements for summary reports per guidance document "Guidance on summary and issue-related analyses for medical devices: Summary reports"
Japan (MHLW/PMDA): Confirm that the person operating the Registered Manufacturing Site has determined and 
implemented effective arrangement for communicating with the Japanese Marketing Authorization Holder in relation to customer feedback, including customer complaints, and advisory notices [MHLW MO169: 29].
United States (FDA): Verify procedures have been defined, documented, and implemented for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit. Procedures must ensure that: 
- All complaints are processed in a uniform and timely manner
- Oral complaints are documented upon receipt
- Complaints are evaluated to determine whether the complaint represents an event which is required to be reported to FDA
Each manufacturer must review and evaluate all complaints to determine whether an investigation is necessary. When no investigation is made, the manufacturer must maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the decision not to 
investigate.
Any complaint of the failure of the device, labeling, or packaging to meet any of its specifications must be reviewed, evaluated, and investigated, unless such investigation has already been made for a similar complaint and another investigation is not necessary.
Any complaint that represents an event which must be reported to FDA must be promptly reviewed, evaluated, and investigated by a designated individual(s) and must be maintained in a separate portion of the complaint files or otherwise clearly identified. Records of investigation must include a 
determination of:
- Whether the device failed to meet specifications
- Whether the device was beings used for treatment or diagnosis
- The relationship, if any, of the device to the reported incident or adverse event. 
When an investigation is made, a record of the investigation must be maintained by the formally designated unit. The record of the investigation must include: 
- The name of the device
- The date the complaint was received
- Any UDI or UPC and control numbers used
- The name, address, and telephone number of the complainant
- The nature and details of the complaint
- The dates and results of investigation
- Any corrective action taken
When the manufacturerâ€™s formally designated unit is located at a site separate from the manufacturing establishment, the investigated complaint(s) and the record(s) of investigation must be reasonably accessible to the manufacturing establishment [21 CFR 820.198].

<Subtask actionitem={"Review any overarching post market surveillance processes, if established."}>
Some teams, especially those in Europe, will have standalone postmarket surveillance processes. 
Some teams will not have processes separate from management review, internal audit, complaint, CAPA, and others that would serve as the input to standalone postmarket surveillance process. Postmarket surveillance procedures typically only differ from the sum of other quality activities by prescribing for clinical literature and publicly available device information review at a prescribed frequency.  
</Subtask>

<Subtask action={"Review complaint processes"}>
One of the most important data types in post-market surveillance is complaint data. Review procedures to understand the internal process for documenting and evaluating complaints. Each team will have a unique but similar documentation set for complaints, usually involving one to three forms to contain the required information. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Sample complaints"}>
Review complaint logs (ask for a log with a issue summary) and select nontrivial complaints. 
Where possible, select complaints that have been identified as trending in management review, or maybe related to other nonconformances observed in CAPA or nonconforming product (NCR) processes.
