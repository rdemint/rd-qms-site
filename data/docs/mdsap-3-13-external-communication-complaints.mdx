<Subtask actionitem={"Identify complaint events in which extrnal notification would be applicable."}>
Typically this will occur when the complaint investigation identifies that a supply chain nonconformance led to the complaint.  This could be related to a raw material, outsourced process, contract manufacturing, etc.
Typically an organization will exchange information with the external party to support an investigation.  A raw material supplier, for example, might be requested to review batch records for a lot in question. 
To be consistent with supplier control processes, an organization is to require suppliers to take corrective action commensurate with risk.  
For low risk and first time occurrences, it would be common for teams to notify suppliers that an investigation has attributed the problem to the supplier, but corrective action may not necessarily be required. 
For higher risk and trending issues, an organization would demonstrate supplier control by requiring supplier corrective action, and possibly heightening in-process controls to detect or prevent use of the supplier's nonconforming product.
