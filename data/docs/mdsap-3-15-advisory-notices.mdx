Confirm that the manufacturer has made effective arrangements for the timely evaluation of quality problems involving distributed product for potential issuance and 
implementation of advisory notices.
Select records for review of quality problems that were evaluated for potential issuance of advisory notices (include records where a decision was made not to issue an advisory 
notice as well as records of decision to issue advisory notices) and assess whether the organization has taken actions appropriately based on risk and documented the rationale.

United States (FDA): See 21 CFR 806: Medical Devices; Reports of Corrections and Removals. Any correction or removal initiated to reduce a risk to health or remedy a violation of the US Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is to be reported within 10 working days of initiation. Records are to be maintained.

Japan (MHLW): Marketing Authorization Holders are required to report advisory notices.

Australia (TGA): Proposed recalls must be reported by the manufacturer to the MDSAP AO, and to the TGA or Sponsor in a timely manner to ensure that a Sponsor can meet their reporting obligations.  See 'Uniform Recall Procedure for Therapeutic Goods'.

Canada (HC): The manufacturer and importer are to provide HC with information 'on or before undertaking a recall', or to be interpreted as within 24 hours of having made the decision to recall. This can be verbal or in writing, but a written report as required by Section 64 is required within 3 business days of starting the recall. A report of results is required as soon as possible after the completion of a recall.
