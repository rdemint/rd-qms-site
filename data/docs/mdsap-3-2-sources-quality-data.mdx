Determine if appropriate sources of quality data have been identified and analyzed according to a documented procedure for use the use of valid statistical methods (where appropriate) for input into the measurement, analysis and improvement process, including customer complaints, feedback, service records, returned product, internal and external audit findings, nonconformities from regulatory audits and inspections, and data from the monitoring of products, processes, nonconforming products, and suppliers.

Corrective action procedures are to scope what types of data are to be considered for corrective action, but in practice this will not be more specific than the management review or post-market surveillance processes. 

In practice, most teams point to an annual management review (and the post-market surveillance program) as overarching evidence of the analysis of quality data and do not have standalone 'analysis' procedures. However, many teams supplement management review with a monthly interim review (perhaps informal) of analyzed data or metrics. It should be considered a best practice to supplement management review with more frequent analysis. 

Teams could also point to the analysis and review performed for individual quality events such as complaints or nonconforming product.  It is common for complaint procedures to require a review of complaint logs for trends, and escalation of issues to the corrective action program as needed. It is common for corrective action to be initiated this way. 
Some data sources that are commonly overlooked in monitoring include
- servicing
- installation
- rework
- environmental monitoring
- incoming inspection
