<RegLang>
Determine if investigations are conducted to identify the underlying cause(s) of detected nonconformities, where possible.
Confirm investigations are commensurate with the risk of the nonconformity.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review the corrective action procedure and nonconforming product procedure for investigation requirements."}>
At this point, the auditor needs to understand if the team separates a corrective action process from the nonconforming product (e.g. 'NC' or 'NCMR') process. Process requirements and documentation commonly differ. 
If there is a separate 'NC' process, we can acknowledge that there are both investigations for NCs and investigations for CAPA, not to mention investigations for complaints. Confirm the investigation process for each is clear and identify any internally established requirements.  Each process might specify a different approach, problem solving tools, timelines, and functional area responsibilities. In the audit model, it is implicit that complaint investigations will be reviewed in <QLink>MDSAP Task 3-12</QLink> 

It's understandable to emphasize the 'NC' process in <QLink>MDSAP Task 3-8 Control of nonconforming product</QLink>, although this can also be documented in 3-3 given there are to be investigations associated with NCs.
We can also acknowledge that all of this overlaps <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-22 Identification, Control, and Disposition of Nonconforming Products</QLink>.

<Subtask actionitem={"Make note of any special requirements used to estimate and classify risk."}>
Some teams define analagous risk categories to the product risk management procedures or use the product risk estimation critria directly. 
Some teams simply make sweeping statements that 'investigation will be commensurate with risk.'
Regardless, confirm that the risk management documentation (i.e. risk analysis, dFMEA, or pFMEA) is used as input to drive the extent of investigations. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Sample and evaluate investigations"}>
Use logs such as the corrective action log to identify events where investigations were performed. Aim to sample events that resulted in both action being taken and no action being taken, so that the level of action can be evaluated against the risk of the nonconformity.
