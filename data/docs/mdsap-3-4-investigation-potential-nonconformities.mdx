<Subtask actionitem={"Review the corrective action procedure and nonconforming product procedure for investigation requirements."}>
Confirm the investigation process is clear and identify any internally established requirements.  These might include approach, problem solving tools, timelines, and functional area responsibilities. In the audit model, it is implicit that complaint investigations will be reviewed in <QLink>MDSAP Task 3-12</QLink>. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Make note of any special requirements used to estimate and classify risk."}>
Some teams define analagous risk categories to the product risk management procedures or use the product risk estimation critria directly. 
Some teams simply make sweeping statements that 'investigation will be commensurate with risk.'
Regardless, confirm that the risk management documentation (i.e. risk analysis, dFMEA, or pFMEA) is used as input to drive the extent of investigations. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Sample and evaluate investigations"}>
Use logs such as the corrective action log to identify events where investigations were performed. Aim to sample events that resulted in both action being taken and no action being taken, so that the level of action can be evaluated against the risk of the nonconformity.
