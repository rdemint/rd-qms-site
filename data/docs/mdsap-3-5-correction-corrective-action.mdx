<Subtask actionitem={"Review the CAPA log"}>
Most all teams maintain a log of CAPA that will inform sampling.  Request a log/list of CAPA that has all open and closed CAPA. Since some teams CAPA can extend many years, be sure the log is not filtered.  
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Potentially sample open CAPA"}>
In the CAPA log, aim to sample at least one CAPA that is open.  The aim is to ensure that teams are taking corrective action in accordance with any planned or required timeframes. Aging CAPA may be a sign of an ineffective process. 
In particular, for CAPAs recently opened, ensure corrections and containment actions have been taken to address any potentially nonconforming product. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Sample closed CAPA"}>
Closed CAPA will reflect that entire CAPA process. Confirm that actions were carried out as planned and verified to be effective. 
</Subtask>
