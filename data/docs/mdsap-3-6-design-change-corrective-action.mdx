<Subtask actionitem={"Identify any design changes related to corrective or preventive action"}>
This task is redundant to task <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-13</QLink>, in which any design changes would also have to be identified and assessed.  However since the CAPA log is currently available, use the opportunity to review it to potentially identify any design changes. Assess them now or note them for assessment in Task 5-13.
