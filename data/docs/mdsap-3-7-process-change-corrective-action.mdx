When a corrective or preventive action results in a process change, confirm that the process change is assessed to determine if any new risks to the product are introduced.
Verify the organization has performed revalidation of processes where appropriate.

This task has redundant country specific tasks for 'significant changes' and 'change notification', which are all to be covered in <QLink>MDSAP Task 2-3</QLink>

<Subtask actionitem={"Identify any process changes related to corrective or preventive action"}>
This task is redundant to task <QLink>MDSAP Task 3-5</QLink> for reviewing how the organization has determined that the actions do not adversely affect the finished devics.  It is also redundant to <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-8</QLink>, in which any process changes would also have to be identified and assessed.  However since the CAPA log is currently available, use the opportunity to review it to potentially identify any process changes. Assess them now or within the corresponding tasks.
