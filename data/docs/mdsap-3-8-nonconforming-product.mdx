<RegLang>
Verify that controls are in place to ensure that product which does not conform to product requirements is identified and controlled to prevent its unintended use or delivery.
Confirm that an appropriate disposition was made, justified, and documented and that any external party responsible for the nonconformity was notified.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review any aspects of nonconforming product processes not yet reviewed."}>
In previous Chapter 3 tasks, nonconforming product procedures have likely already been reviewed for investigation of nonconformities, correction, and perhaps input to corrective action.  
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review quality events involving nonconforming product"}>
Corrective Action and Nonconformance Reports have already been sampled for investigation of nonconformities, corrections, and corrective action.  In the current task, it should be ensured that audit sampling has covered instances where nonconforming product was involved.  A nonconforming product log and CAPA log should be reviewed so that event summaries can guide sampling to higher-risk events. 
Ideally, quality events involving different disposition types (inspect/sort, use-as-is, rework, return to supplier, etc.) can be sampled.
