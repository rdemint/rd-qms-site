<Subtask actionitem={"Identify events in which nonconforming product was released for commercial distribution."}>
Interview internal personnel seeking to identify these events. Use internal logs such as CAPA or NCR for confirmation.  Management review is also to contain information on reporting to regulatory authorities, so it may be useful to identify these types of events.    
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Evaluate the risk-based approach and confirm it aligns with the risk management policies."}>
Some teams do not have alignment between the risk estimation approaches in their NCR / CAPA process and their product risk management process (i.e. process related to ISO 14971). Furthermore, some teams do not ensure that the product risk management documentation is used to make such decisions.  Confirm that risk estimations related to CAPA / NCR do not differ from the formal risk management documentation, and team members involved are competent to make such risk estimations.
