<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm list of commercial devices and devices in development."}>
Different teams will have different levels of design activity.  Multiple projects might have to be selected depending on recent design activity, commercialization of devices in different markets, and device classification. 
Identify the list of all device families to inform all later sampling.
Link to <QLink>MDSAP 5-12 Software design and development</QLink>: If the device contains software or is software, do not wait until Task 5-12 to review documentation.  Review documentation for planning, inputs, outputs, etc. in the following tasks.
