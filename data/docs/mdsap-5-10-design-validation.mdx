<Subtask actionitem={"Review evidence that samples used for design verification and validation are production representative"}>
Using the currently sampled documents or previously sampled design verification documents, ask for evidence that the samples were production representative.  Typically, this takes the form of production records being available. The production records commonly used initial versions or drafts of different design outputs, including BOMs, drawings, specs, and manufacturing work instructions.
