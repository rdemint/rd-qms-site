<Subtask actionitem={"Review design input documentation with a lens for ambiguity, completeness, and conflicts."}>
The necessary documents should already be available from <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-5 Design Input</QLink>. While that task took a lens of design input breadth and category, this task takes an alternate lens.
Most commonly, teams will struggle to make design inputs unambiguous, meaning that it is not clear how to derive design verification criteria.  For example stating that the 'device must be clean and sterile', without referencing a numerical sterility assurance level (SAL), would be ambiguous.
