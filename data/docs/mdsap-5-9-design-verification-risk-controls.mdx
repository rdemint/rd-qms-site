<Subtask actionitem={"Review design verification and validation activities for evidence of implementation and effectiveness of risk controls"}>
Review verification and validation reports.  Implementation of risk controls is to be knowable through reference to controlled design documents.   
For example, for a risk control related to a tolerance, the design verification report would reference that tolerance in the acceptance criteria (or reference the design document containing the tolerance).
Ensure that the risk controls are ultimately carried forward to product-specific design documentation (such as a drawing or spec sheet).
Link to <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-10 Monitoring and Measurement of Product Conformity</QLink>:  Design related risk controls would be expected to have ongoing monitoring and measurement activities, if not subject to process validation.
