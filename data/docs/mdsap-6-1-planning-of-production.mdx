<RegLang>
Verify that the product realization processes are planned, including any necessary controls, controlled conditions, and risk management activities required for the product to meet the specified or intended uses, the statutory and regulatory requirements related to the product, and (when applicable) unique device identifier requirements.
United States (FDA): Confirm that the medical device organization has determined the applicability of unique device identifier requirements per 21 CFR 801 and 21 CFR 830, has obtained the unique device identifiers from an FDA accredited UDI-issuing agency, and the required data elements have been entered in the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) [21 CFR 801, 830].

<Subtask actionitem={"Review any production planning procedures."}>
This task is redundant to other tasks.  Production planning is to already occur for a successful design transfer, and product realization is assessed throughout Chapter 6 and Chapter 7. 
However, some teams maintain standalone production planning procedures (which are usually entirely redundant to other procedures in scope of product realization). Ideally, these can outline unique internal requirements around documentation and the expected document types associated with a commercial product.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review implementation of UDI and submission to GUDID"}>
Review UDI procedures. Review the GUDID database and compare against the organization's internally documented UDI information for alignment (i.e. around model and version number).
Note: This task is arguably more related to design inputs or design transfer.  Everyone else is just as confused as you.
