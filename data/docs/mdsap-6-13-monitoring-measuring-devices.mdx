title: MDSAP Task 6-13 Control of monitoring and measuring device
summary: Confirm that the medical device organization has determined the monitoring and measuring devices needed to provide evidence of conformity to specified requirements. Verify that the monitoring and measuring equipment used in production and service control has been identified, adjusted, calibrated and maintained, and capable of producing valid results.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review calibration procedures and how calibration requirements are established."}>
Calibration requirements are to include calibration type(s), frequencies and accuracy and precision if different from manufacturer specifications. 
For example, a band sealer may be treated as a single asset but the underlying equipment requires calibration for heat, time, and pressure. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review calibration logs to determine if calibration is timely"}>
Interview personnel and review how assets are tracked to ensure calibration is timely. For any overdue calibrations, review how the assets have been taken out of service to prevent use.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review calibration records and data"}>
Calibration is typically performed by an external service provider.  Methods of calibration, date, equipment used, traceability of equipment used to NIST or equivalent, calibration data, etc. are all to be in the calibration records.

Sample calibration records for equipment used in acceptance activities as well as environmental monitoring.

Prioritize sampling for equipment that is known to be in use, such as the equipment observed on the production tour and the equipment documented in the production records reviewed.
