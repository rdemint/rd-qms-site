Determine if the medical device organization has established and maintained a file for each type of device that includes or refers to the location of device specifications, production process specifications, quality assurance procedures, traceability requirements, and packaging, labeling specifications, and when applicable requirements for installation and servicing.

Australia (TGA):Verify that the design and location of information to be provided with a medical device, including labelling and instructions for use, comply with Essential Principle 13 and implant cards and leaflets with Essential principle 13A.

Brazil (ANVISA):Verify that the manufacturer has established and maintains procedures to ensure integrity and to prevent 
accidental mixing of labels, instructions, and packaging materials [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.2.2.1].
Confirm that the manufacturer has ensured that labels are designed, printed and, where applicable, applied so 
that they remain legible and attached to the product during processing, storage, handling and use [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.2.2.2].

Canada (HC):Verify that the Manufacturer maintains objective evidence that devices meet the safety and effectiveness 
requirements. [CMDR 9(2)].
Verify that devices sold in Canada have labeling that conforms to Canadian English and French language requirements and contains the Manufacturerâ€™s name and address, device identifier, control number (for Class III and IV devices), contents of packaging, sterility, expiry, intended use, directions for use and any special storage conditions [CMDR 21-23]. 

Verify that the Manufacturer maintains distribution records in respect of a device that will permit a complete and rapid withdrawal of the device from the market [CMDR 52-56].

United States (FDA): If a control number is required for traceability, confirm that a control number is on, or accompanies the device throughout distribution [21 CFR 820.120(e)].

<Subtask actionitem={"Confirm device master records have been sampled in the audit"}>
Another sequence flaw in the MDSAP audit model, the device master record should have already been sampled at the beginning of Chapter 6, especially for <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-3 Controls for the implementation of Selected Production and Service Process(es)</QLink>. 

We can acknowledge this is only possible to sample if the organization maintains a DMR as an index, or else the team simply say 'yes, we maintain all the required documents'. Teams are not required to maintain an index.

But it is practical both for auditors and teams to have a DMR index, in order to have some top level visibility to what documents are relevant to a specific product.  If a team does not maintain an index, review how it is to be confirmed which specifications, drawings, procedures, etc. are applicable to a product.  This is practical question from an operations standpoint, and every team will have some top-level document or a core set of documents from which all others can be found.

We can also acknowledge that 'DMR' (device master record) is an FDA term from 21 CFR 820, often used interchangeably with the 'MDF' (medical device file) described in ISO 13485.  MDSAP, to be unique it seems, must use yet an another additional term 'Device Master File'.
