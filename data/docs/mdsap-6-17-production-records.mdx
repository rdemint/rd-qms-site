Determine if the medical device organization has established and maintained a record of the amount manufactured and approved for distribution for each batch of medical devices, the record is verified and approved, the device is manufactured according to the file referenced in Task 16, and the requirements for product release were met and documented.
Brazil (ANVISA):
Verify that the device history record of the product includes or refers to the following information: date of manufacture; components used; quantity manufactured; results of inspections and tests; parameters of special processes; quantity released for distribution; labeling; identification of the serial number or batch of production; and final release of the product [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 3.2.1].
Verify that labeling has not been released for storage or use until a designated individual has examined the labeling for accuracy. The approval, including the date, name, and physical or electronic signature of the person responsible, must be documented in the device history record [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.2.2.3].

United States (FDA): Verify that labeling is not released for storage or use until a designated individual has examined the labeling for accuracy including, where applicable, the correct unique device identifier (UDI) or Universal Product Code

<Subtask actionitem={"Review the distribution log and other means to sample DHR"}>
The distribution log is an effective means to sample production records because it provides information about which devices were distributed to which markets, and when.
This can be linked to marketing authorization per <QLink>MDSAP Task 1-10 Distribution of Devices with Appropriate Marketing Authorization</QLink> and <QLink>MDSAP Task 2-2 Evidence of Marketing Clearance or Approval</QLink>.

Other DHR sampling may come from process validation records and lot numbers observed in nonconforming product reports and CAPA.

Link to <QLink>MSAP Task 6-21 Acceptance Activities</QLink>: The DHRs sampled are also to be an input to this task to evidence acceptance activities.
