If the medical device organization manufactures active or non-active implantable medical devices, life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, confirm that the medical device organization maintains traceability records of all components, materials, and work environment conditions (if these could cause the medical device to not satisfy its  specified requirements) in addition to records of the identity of personnel performing any inspection or testing of these devices.
Confirm that the medical device organization requires that agents or distributors of these devices maintain distribution records and makes them available for inspection.
Verify that the medical device organization records the name and address of shipping consignees for these devices.
Canada (HC):
Verify that the Manufacturer has identified Schedule 2 implants and provides implant registration cards with devices or employs another suitable system approved by Health Canada [CMDR 66-68].
Verify that the Manufacturer of devices that are listed on Schedule 2 of the Medical Devices Regulations maintains distribution records of these devices as well as any information received on implant registration cards related to these Schedule 2 devices [CMDR 54].
United States (FDA): Verify that the manufacturer has implemented a tracking system for devices for which the manufacturer has received a tracking order from FDA. The tracking system must ensure the manufacturer is able to track the device to the end-user. The manufacturer must conduct periodic audits of the tracking system [21 CFR 821].

<Subtask actionitem={"Review distribution log"}>
The distribution log should have already been sampled to sample production records in <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-17 Production records</QLink>.  Nothing additional should be required here. 
</Subtask>
<Subtask actionitem={"Review sampled DHR and traceability of components and materials"}>
Review the production records already sampled in <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-17 Production records</QLink> or pull additional records. Teams either assign an internal lot number to all parts and materials or use the supplier lot numbers.  If internal lot numbers are assigned, potentially review the instruction by which this is done.
