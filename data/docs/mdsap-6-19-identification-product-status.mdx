<Subtask actionitem={"Review identification procedures and compare with observation on the production tour."}>
Most teams prevent mix-ups with nonconforming product by requiring nonconforming product to be labeled as such and/or physically separated into a quarantine area. Anything less is an opportunity for improvement.
Otherwise, 'product status' is typically knowable through the accompanying production records that travel with a production run.  Has this product been inspected or not? Look at the production record. 
For warehouse areas, it is not uncommon for containers to be given a colored sticker or signed by QC when released for storage, but this is often not practical in the normal production environment.
