<QdocList docs={['process flow chart', 'device master record']}/>

<ReportLang>
The following processes were prioritized for sampling. 
</ReportLang>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review top-level production documentation to understand and prioritize production processes."}>
A production flow chart or device master record should be requested in order to confirm the processes involved in production. 

These documents can be used for understanding and certain processes can be prioritized, with special consideration for quality data (and problems) reviewed in Chapter 3.

However in practice, this task has somewhat limited impact on the rest of Chapter 6.  The remaining Chapter 6 tasks will require that a variety of production processes are considered (processes involving cleanliness, processes involving validation, processes involving monitoring and measuring, etc.).  
The auditor is not limited to the prioritized processes for th remainder of the audit.
