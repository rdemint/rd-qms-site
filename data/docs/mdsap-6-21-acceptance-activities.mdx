<RegLang>
Verify that acceptance activities assure conformity with specifications and are documented. Confirm that the extent of acceptance activities is commensurate with the risk posed by the device.
Brazil (ANVISA): Verify that sampling plans are defined and based on valid statistical rationale. Each manufacturer must establish and maintain procedures to ensure that sampling methods are suitable for their intended use and are reviewed regularly. A review of sampling plans should consider the occurrence of nonconforming product, quality audit reports, complaints and other indicators [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 9.2].
United States (FDA): Verify that the manufacturer establishes and maintains procedures to ensure that sampling methods are 
adequate for their intended use and ensure that when changes occur, the sampling plans are reviewed [21 CFR 
820.250(b)].

<Subtask actionitem={"Determine the method by which the organization has determined the acceptance activities to be performed."}>
This is often opaque for most teams and difficult to determine in the time allowed for an audit.  It fundamentally goes back to <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-16 Design Transfer</QLink>, where 'design specifications are translated into production specifications.' Unfortunately, most teams neither have a process nor clear  traceability from design specifications to a production verification or validation.  It is implied that this has been achieved through the approval of design transfer.

Interview key team members and review any available instruction which describes how production acceptance activities are derived from design specifications.

<Subtask actionitem={"Identify the documents which define the acceptance activities to be performed."}>
The DHRs will record what acceptance activities were performed, but ideally this can be compared to manufacturing and quality work instructions which define acceptance activities. Confirm these two sets align.  Confirm it is clear what sampling plans are to be applied to each acceptance activity. 

Acceptance records are to contain
- the activities performed, 
- the results, 
- the date, 
- the signature of the individual(s) conducting the acceptance activities; and 
- where appropriate the equipment used. 

Link to <QLink>MDSAP 6-8 Process Validation</QLink>: Consider that when sampling plans have been applied and full verification is not implemented, process validation is applicable.
Note: This task and <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-10 Monitoring and Measuring of Product Conformity</QLink> are partially redundant to each other.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review sampling in the production records applied against established procedures."}>
Sampling plans are often based on lot size, though special sampling may also take place with fixed sample sizes.  Compare lot sizes in the DHR as needed to confirm sampling (i.e. AQLs) were correctly applied. 
If the organization has a variable sampling scheme (i.e. reduced, tightened), confirm the correct level was used.
