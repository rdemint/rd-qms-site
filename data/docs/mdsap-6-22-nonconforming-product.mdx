<Subtask actionitem={"Review the nonconforming product procedure"}>
The NC process may have been reviewed, and NCs, sampled, back in Chapter 3.  Perform any additional evaluation needed now. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Make note of any special requirements used to estimate and classify risk."}>
Some teams define analagous risk categories to the product risk management procedures or use the product risk estimation criteria directly. 
Some teams simply make sweeping statements that 'investigation will be commensurate with risk.'
Regardless, confirm that the risk management documentation (i.e. risk analysis, dFMEA, or pFMEA) is used as input to drive the extent of investigations. 
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Sample and evaluate nonconforming product events"}>
Use logs to identify events where investigations were performed. Aim to sample events that resulted in different dispositions such as inspect/sort, use-as-is, scrap, return to vendor, or rework.
