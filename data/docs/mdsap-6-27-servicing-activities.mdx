Determine if servicing activities are conducted and documented in accordance with defined and implemented instructions and procedures.
Confirm that service records are used as a source of quality data in the Measurement, Analysis and Improvement process.

Brazil (ANVISA):
Confirm that the manufacturer has established and maintains procedures to ensure that records of servicing 
activities are kept with the following information: 
- the product serviced
- the control number of the product serviced
- the date of completion of service
- identification of the service provider
- description of service performed
- results of inspections and tests performed [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 8.2.1].
Verify that the manufacturer periodically reviews the records of servicing activities. In cases where the analysis 
identifies trends that pose danger or records involving death or serious injury, a corrective or preventive action 
must be initiated [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 8.2.2].
United States (FDA): Verify that each manufacturer who receives a service report that represents an event that must be reported to FDA as a medical device report automatically considers the report a complaint [21 CFR 820.200(c)].
Confirm that service reports are documented and include the name of the device serviced, any unique device identifier (UDI) or universal product code (UPC), and any other device identification(s) and control number(s) used; and the date of service [21 CFR 820.200(d)].
