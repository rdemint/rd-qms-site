<Subtask actionitem={"Ensure that audit sampling has covered controls for delivery and post-delivery activities."}>

This is a redundant task, just use this opportunity to review the previous sampling and sample these topics if unsampled.

Common items to review include package validation reports, installation, and servicing procedures

We can acknowledge that this is a redundant task to <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-9 Design Verification or Design Validation to Confirm Effectiveness of Risk Control Measures</QLink>, <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-26 Installation Activities</QLink> and <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-27 Servicing Activities</QLink>.

The requirements for delivery, installation, and servicing of a particular device should have been evaluated and addressed by the organization during design and development process.  A failure to define risk controls for post-release is a failure of risk management <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-8 Risk Management Activities Applied Throughout the Design and Development Project</QLink>, and a failure to implement those risk controls is a failure of <QLink>MDSAP Task 5-16 Design Transfer</QLink>.  Furthermore, this task is redundant to <QLink>MDSAP Task 6-3 Production and Service Controls</QLink> which specifically mentions to review controls for 'the implementation of release, delivery, and post-delivery activities'.
