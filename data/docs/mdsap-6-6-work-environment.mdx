<Subtask actionitem={"Identify different types of environments and corresponding controls."}>
Does the organization maintain a controlled environment or a clean room as categorized by ISO 14644-1? Most teams manufacturing devices that are delivered sterile will have Class 7 or Class 8 cleanroom.  Expect cascading levels of control applied to cleanrooms, gowning rooms, and external environments.
Identify other environments, such as warehouses, review procedures which ensure those environments are suitable.  This typically includes pest control and perhaps temperature and humidity monitoring if relevant to the product.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem={"Review environmental monitoring and certifications"}>
If the organization has a cleanroom, ensure that they perform monitoring as required.  Some teams will required themselves to have an annual certification performed by an external clean room firm.
