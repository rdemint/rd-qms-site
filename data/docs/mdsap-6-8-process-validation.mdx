Verify that the selected process(es) have been validated according to documented procedures if the result of the process cannot be fully verified or can be verified, but is not.
Confirm that the validation demonstrates the ability of the process/es to consistently achieve the planned result.

In the event changes have occurred to a previously validated process, confirm that the process was reviewed and evaluated, and re-validation was performed where appropriate.
