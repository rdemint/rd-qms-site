<Subtask actionitem={"Verify procedures for the purchasing and supplier control have been document."}>
This task is purely to identify the procedures, while the next task <QLink>MDSAP Task-4 Extent of Controls Applied to the Supplier and Purchased Product; criteria for selection, evaluation, and re-evaluation of the supplier</QLink> involves evaluating the instruction of these procedures.
An obvious flaw in the audit model, we can acknowledge that these two tasks be combined.
