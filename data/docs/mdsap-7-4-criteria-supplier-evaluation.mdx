Verify that the procedures assure the type and extent of control applied to the supplier and the purchased product is dependent upon the effect of the purchased product on subsequent 
product realization or the final product.
Verify that criteria for the selection, evaluation and re-evaluation of suppliers have been 
established and documented.

<ReportLang>
Suppliers classified into different risk categories with corresponding risk controls.
That controls that are applied to higher-risk suppliers include quality agreements, auditing, and performance monitoring.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review selection, evaluation, and approval criteria"}>
Supplier selection criteria is often (and accepted by auditors to be) vague and broad statements such as 'supplier shall be capable of meeting requirements'.  
The process starts to become tangible with supplier classification.  Almost all teams categorize suppliers into tiers/categories that are then automatically associated to default risk controls.  Two or three categories are common, though some teams really differentiate with seven or more. 
Criteria can include a quality management system and corresponding ISO certification (ISO 13485, ISO 9001, etc.).  But in reality teams often do not impose rigid requirements for themselves here.  Usually if a supplier does not have an ISO certification, they just have to fill out a questionnaire on the supplier's quality-related business processes, as evidence things are somewhat in control.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review the controls applied to higher-risk suppliers."}>
Expected controls include quality agreements and auditing for higher risk suppliers.  
Quality agreements commonly contain items such as 
- responsibility to maintain a QMS  and/or QMS certification
- instruction for how changes are to be communicated and controlled
- agreement that the supplier will allow recurring audits related to the supplied product
- agreement that supplier will support investigations, corrective actions
- supplier record retention requirements and record sharing upon request
Teams commonly give exemptions from audits to those suppliers with externally certified quality management systems, although this exemption is almost never given to contract manufacturers (this would 'not be commensurate with risk').
Some teams also have supplemental performance monitoring to Management Review (for instances on a monthly basis).
