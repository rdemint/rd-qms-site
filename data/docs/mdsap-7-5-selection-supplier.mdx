Verify that suppliers are selected based on their ability to supply product or services in accordance with the medical device organization’s specified requirements.
Confirm that the degree of control applied to the supplier is commensurate with the significance of the supplied product or service on the quality of the finished device, based on risk. Verify that records of supplier evaluations are maintained.
Australia (TGA):
The conformity assessment procedures require that a Manufacturer demonstrates compliance with the Essential Principles through application of a QMS. Hence a Manufacturer must show how risk management principles have been applied during design and construction, including purchasing, to mitigate risk. (EP 2 -TG(MD)R Sch1 P1 2).
The conditions of marketing authorization (ARTG inclusion) require that Australian Sponsors undertake some regulatory activities including; customer complaint handling (Act s 41FN, Reg 5.8), the management and communication of technical files /technical documentation (Act s 41FN(3)), adverse event reporting (Act s 41FN, Reg 5.7), conducting recalls (Part 4-9), ensuring that the name and address of the Sponsor is provided with the device (Reg 10.2), the storage of devices (Act s 41FN,Reg 5.9) and the keeping of complaint and distribution 
records (Act s 41FN,Reg 5.10). Some Sponsors also provide services for the installation and servicing of a device on behalf of the Manufacturer. 
Where a regulatory requirement for a Sponsor intersects with a regulatory requirement or a requirement of ISO13485 for the Manufacturer, the activity is to be treated as an outsourced activity and documented in the Manufacturer’s QMS. Verify that the Manufacturer has adequate supplier controls to mitigate risk and ensure the Sponsor fulfils the outsourced activities included in a written agreement [TG Act 41FN] for those activities.
Other activities that may be outsourced to the Sponsor include making applications on behalf of the Manufacturer to the TGA [TG Act s41EB], representing the Manufacturer in interactions with the TGA [TG Act s41FN(3)], as an intermediary in recalls of products [TG(MD)R Sch 3 - Part 1:1.4(3)], in the notification of substantial changes to a kind of medical device (TG Act s41BE) that may require a variation to an entry in the 
Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (TG Act s9D), for the provision of records [TG(MD)R Schedule 3 - Part 1:1.5, 1.9 ], or other matters that may be required to allow the Sponsor to fulfill market authorization conditions [TG Act Part 4-5 Div 2].
Canada (HC): Verify that any regulatory correspondent used by the Manufacturer is treated as a supplier and is adequately 
qualified.
