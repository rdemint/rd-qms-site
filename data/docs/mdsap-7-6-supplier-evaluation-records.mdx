<Subtask actionitem={"Review the controls applied to the supplier on an ongoing basis for consistency to the planned controls from supplier evaluation and approval."}>
If during supplier evaluation it was determined than an annual supplier audit would be required, review recent supplier audit reports. 
Other review could include updated agreements, review of the supplier's renewed QMS certificates, etc.
We can acknowledge that one of the most common and important applied controls is inspection of supplier product, yet this gets its own task in <QLink>MDSAP Task 7-10 Verification of purchased products</QLink>.  Therefore, you may just review the administrative controls in the current task, as incoming inspection will be revisited. 
</Subtask>

The language of this task title is confusing, as the 'records of supplier evaluation' were already reviewed in <QLink>MDSAP Task 7-5 Selection of suppliers...</QLink> where we had to 'Verify that records of supplier evaluations are maintained.'.
This is further confused by the following task name <QLink>MDSAP Task 7 - Effective controls over suppliers and products</QLink> is not actually about the review of applied ongoing controls, but rather the re-evaluation of suppliers. 
This task is actually the correct task to review the applied ongoing controls, such as supplier audit.
