Supplier files of 7-2 evidenced suppliers are reevaluated at intervals described by procedures and instruction reviewed in 7-3 and 7-4.

<Subtask actionitem={"Review supplier reevaluation records."}>
Teams typically establish a program to reevaluate suppliers every one or two years.  This typically occurs on a form where supplier data (nonconforming events, audit findings, supplier corrective actions, etc.) is note. Management determines whether or not to disqualify the supplier or require corrective action based on the data. 
</Subtask>
Yet another confusing Chapter 7 task name, the instruction given by MDSAP AU P0002 makes it clear this task is actually relevant to supplier re-evaluation, rather than supplier controls.  One could be difficult and note that supplier re-evaluation is one method of supplier control, which is true, but it doesn't make the distinction between this task and Task 7-6 any clearer!
