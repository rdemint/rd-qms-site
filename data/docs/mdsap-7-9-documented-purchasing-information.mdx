<Subtask actionitem={"Review released purchase orders."}>
Quality agreements should have already been reviewed as part of 7-5 and/or 7-8. Review released purchase orders now with the understanding gained in 7-8 of where purchasing information is sourced from. 
It's common to compare the information on POs (part number, revision) with other controlled design information.
Ensure that POs include appropriate identifying information to uniquely identify the purchased product. 
Ensure that any required tests, inspections, or other risk controls are documented on the purchase order.
